# Molly the Mermaid

Molly the Mermaid is my 2022 badge project, following on from 2020's [Candy the Catacorn](https://galaxyallie.space/Candy-the-Catacorn/). Molly is a work in progress and all aspects are subject to change.

Preliminary plans are:

- Mermaid tail PCB intended to be used with a hand-made mermaid body for customization.
- RP2040-based project
- Based on existing open-source schematic, modified to meet mermaid needs
- Limited run compared to Candy the Catacorn - making 50 badges was so tiring I didn't want to make any 2021 badge.
- Intended completion May 2022
- Bright shiny things
- Better suited for writing games than Candy was
